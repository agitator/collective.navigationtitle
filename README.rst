collective.navigationtitle
====================

This package allows to add a navigation title by registering a behavior for your dexterity content type.
If you then fill out the field in your content object, this title will be used in the navigation tree.

Big thank you to Jonas Bauman and Jens Klein for all the insights!

Bootstrap this package if needed as described in https://community.plone.org/t/not-using-bootstrap-py-as-default
